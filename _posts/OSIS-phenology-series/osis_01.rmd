```{r loadStuff}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

ind <- read.csv('N:/Common/TOS/OSIS_dataLessons/phe_data HARVperindividual_Clean.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE )
status <- read.csv('N:/Common/TOS/OSIS_dataLessons/phe_data HARV2014statusintensity_Clean.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```


Explore the data, let's get to know what the dataframe looks like.

```{r}
#What are the fieldnames in this dataset?
names(ind)
#how many rows are in the data?
nrow(ind)
#look at the first six rows of data.
head(ind)
#look at the structure of the dataframe.
str(ind)

# What variables are included in this dataset?
names(status)
nrow(status)
head(status)
str(status)

```


join dataframes
```{r}

#select status fields of interest
# create a new object "ind2" to preserve the original object "ind"
ind2 <- select(ind, c(individualID, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, geodeticDatum, coordinateUncertainty,
                      elevation, elevationUncertainty, addDate, dropDate))


#Create a new dataframe "phe" that has all of the fields of interest from both original data frames
phe <- left_join(status, ind2, by='individualID')

```

1. Filter by phenophase of interest

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#see which phenophases are present
unique(phe$phenophaseName)

#subset to just the "leaves" and "Colored leaves" phenophases
# overwrite object "phe" as you know these are the only phenophases you want to work with for now
phe <- filter(phe, phenophaseName=="Leaves" | phenophaseName=="Colored leaves")

# check that it worked
unique(phe$phenophaseName)


```

```{r}

```

4. Calculate the phenophase
total Yes of total Individuals

```{r}
#yep, this is where i will calculate percentages of individuals with status =yes vs status = no

```

Plot - bar graph of % of individuals in different phenophase over course of year. Interval = Daily. 


```{r}

```
